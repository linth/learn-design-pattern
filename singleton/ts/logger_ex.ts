/**
 * Singleton pattern in TypeScript for a real-world scenario.
 * 
 * 常見的的實際範例就是 logging 使用 singleton design pattern.
 * 
 * The Logger is a common example of a class that implements the Singleton pattern. 
 * In most cases, you want to have only one instance of the logger in your application 
 * so that you can log messages from different parts of the application and have them 
 * all go to the same place. By using the Singleton pattern, you can ensure that there 
 * is only one instance of the logger class and that all log messages are directed to that instance.
